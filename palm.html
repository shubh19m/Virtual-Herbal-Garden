            </ul>

            <h4>Environmental Benefits</h4>
            <li>Carbon Sequestration: Palm trees absorb significant amounts of CO2.</li>
            <li>Erosion Control: The roots stabilize the soil in coastal and sandy areas.</li>
            <li>Habitat Creation: They provide shelter and food for various bird and animal species.</li>
            
            <h4>Cultivation and Growth</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Preferred Climate: Thrives in tropical and subtropical climates with abundant sunlight and rainfall.</li>
                <li>Soil Requirements: Adapts to a variety of soils, including sandy and loamy soils, but requires good drainage.</li>
                <li>Propagation Methods: Grown from seeds or suckers (depending on species).</li>
